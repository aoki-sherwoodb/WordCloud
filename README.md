# wordCloud
A project for Data Structures with Anna Rafferty at Carleton College. 
Creates HTML word clouds from text files. Uses a tree implementation of a map to store words and their counts from the input files.

To display only the words and their respective counts, the filename of the text file should be the only argument.

To create a word cloud based on the desired text file, the first argument should be the name of the text file, the second should be the number of words to be displayed in the cloud,
and the third should be file name which the word cloud HTML will be saved to.
